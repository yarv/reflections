What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you tell git to
set up a directory to be tracked by git. You need
to do so in order for git to properly store version
info.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and repository? What value do you think
it offers?

The staging area is a subset of your working directory
destined for the next commit. Its useful since you may
only want to commit some of the files in your working
directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have
one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area along with git diff to
ensure that all that is being committed is one logical
change.
