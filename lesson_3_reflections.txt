When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository if you plan 
on sharing your work, or to ensure that data is backed
up remotely in case your local machine breaks down.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Having changes automatically pulled may result in
conflicts with your own local work.
