When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository if you plan 
on sharing your work, or to ensure that data is backed
up remotely in case your local machine breaks down.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Having changes automatically pulled may result in
conflicts with your own local work.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches exist within a repository and keep a log of
different commits, possibly from different users,
most likely working on different features/resolving
different bugs. They generally have a common ancestor.
A clone of a repository is a copy of a repository,
generally kept on a separate machine, connected
via git remote. A fork is the same as a clone, but
represents a copy of someone else's repository on
GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last
known state of the remote stored locally?

Having as much as possible of the remote stored
locally helps ensure that merging will create
a minimal number of conflicts.
